## A program to find the highest-paid manager and the average of the managers' total pay

The program first asks the user to input the number of managers. After which, a loop runs a number of times that is equivalent to the number of managers. The user inputs details relating to the manager, such as his name, hours worked, bonus, and wage. Then, the program calculates the total payout of each manager and compares it with the highedt_paid_manager, and if the new manager's payout is higher than the older highest-paid one, it will replace it. The total payout of all of the managers is also added together. Then, the average amount of all of the managers is calculated, and at the end, the highest-paid manager is printed along with the average amount earned by the managers.

This Program consists of five files:
1) The Employee Header File
2) The Employee Implementation File
3) The Manager Header File
4) The Manager Implementation File
5) The Main File

Running the Program:
To Run the Program, first, compile it using the gear button on the top (it may be different depending on the interface you use). Secondly, press the run button. Then, follow the instructions properly to achieve the expected results.
